Proveeded the training process of a neural network model, likely a convolutional neural network, over 75 epochs for a classification task.
Throughout training, both training and validation losses steadily decrease, indicating that the model is learning and improving its predictive performance. 
Simultaneously, the accuracies for both training and validation datasets increase, suggesting that the model is becoming more adept at classifying the data 
it was trained on and unseen validation data. It's noteworthy that the validation loss and accuracy are critical metrics to monitor
for potential overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Ideally, the testing loss should not be
significantly higher than the training loss, as this suggests overfitting, where the model fails to generalize well to unseen data. Similarly, while the testing accuracy might be 
slightly lower than the training accuracy, a significant disparity could also indicate overfitting, emphasizing the importance of regularizing techniques and monitoring both training 
and validation performance closely.
